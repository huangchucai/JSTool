Created a object container common tools used a lot in writing javascript when adding event. Try to figure out the compatible problem against horrible IE. Just for practice.     

This object has these method temporaily:

- addHandler(element, type, handler)
- removeHandler(element, type, handler)
- getEvent(event)
- getTarget(event)
- preventDefault(evnet)
- stopPropagation(event)
- getButton(event)
- getWheelData(event)
- getChardCode(event)
